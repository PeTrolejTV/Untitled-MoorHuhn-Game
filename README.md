## Introduction

The game celebrates the classic Moorhuhn series â€” those delightfully absurd bird-shooting games that mixed quick reflexes with ridiculous fun.
This reinterpretation, built with **JavaFX**, keeps the heart of that chaos alive but replaces the rustic countryside look with a more original and goofy visual style â€” think exaggerated animations, playful shapes, and tongue-in-cheek art direction. Itâ€™s a tribute that doesnâ€™t take itself too seriously â€” just like the original.

Players face the eternal question: **will you spare the chickens, or let them burn for the high score?**

## Inspiration

*Untitled MoorHuhn Game* draws its roots from the classic Moorhuhn series, a cult favorite of the late 1990s and early 2000s. These games became famous for their simple yet addictive gameplay, absurd humor, and over-the-top arcade chaos.

## Gameplay

The gameplay focuses on precision, timing, and resource management.  
Chickens fly across the screen in unpredictable patterns, and the player must shoot them before time runs out.

## Scoring System

Points are awarded based on chicken size, speed, and your sharpshooting skills. Tiny, zippy chickens are worth more than slow, clumsy ones, rewarding quick reflexes and precision.
Combos, streaks, and clever use of power-ups multiply your score, turning frantic chicken-chasing into a strategic (and hilarious) arcade challenge.

All high scores are saved locally and proudly displayed in the **Leaderboard**, letting you compare results and aim for legendary chicken-slaying glory.

## Art and Visuals

All of the visuals in Untitled MoorHuhn Game were hand-painted by me using a mouse, giving the game a truly personal and quirky touch. The style is intentionally goofy and arcade-like, almost like something a kindergarten class might proudly display â€” exaggerated shapes, silly proportions, and bright, cheerful colors.

Animations are over-the-top, with chickens flapping wildly, smoke trails puffing, and comical burn effects, all designed to make the chaos fun, chaotic, and visually entertaining. Every frame celebrates the lighthearted, absurd spirit of the game.
